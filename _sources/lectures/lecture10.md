# Lecture 10: Ethics, Summary, and Career 
TBA

<!-- We conclude this unit by discussing a pressing topic on (geo)ethics. Examples are used to illustrate its importance in spatial data science, as well as in geographic information retrieval more specifically in the context of preserving locational information for social good. We then summarize concepts, techniques, and tools that were covered in this unit. Finally, we close the lecture with a discussion on careers as a spatial data scientist.
