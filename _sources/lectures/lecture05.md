# Lecture 05: Georeferencing II 
<!-- TBA -->

This is the second part on the topic of Georeferencing. We first finish our discussion on addressing the challenges in geoparsing. We then introduce geocoder, which is the process after a geoparser. Its challenges and state-of-the-art methods are elabrated too. In the practical ({doc}`../labs/lab02`), we will work on implementing a simple geocoder, and then check one popular library to automate the process.
